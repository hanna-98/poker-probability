# poker-probability

Using JavaScript to evaluate / verify the probability of having certain poker hands.

# instructions

1. generate random 5-card poker hands
2. check if the generated hand is of certain types
3. count the occurrence of certain hand types
4. present the probabilities

# requirements

You should check for at least the following types::

- Three-of-a-Kind
- Four-of-a-Kind
- Full-House
- Straight
- Flush
- Straight Flush

Your program should have the global constant NUM_TRIALS. This indicates the number of hands to be generated in the whole simulation.

Your program should finally console.log the empirical probability you found during your simulation.
i.e., the number of occurrences of certain hand type divided by NUM_TRIALS for each hand-type.
